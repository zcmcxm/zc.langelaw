<p>WandaVision is a Marvel television miniseries.
  It's full of novelty and touching plot lines for me.
</p>
<p>Some scripts I like so much, and I'd like to share some:<br><br>
  - You, Vision, are the piece of the Mind Stone that lives in me.
  You are a body of wires and blood and bone that I created.
  - You are my sadnesss and my hope. But mostly, you are my love.<br><br>
  - We have said goodbye before. So it stands to reason that...<br>
  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We'll say hello again.<br><br>
  But what is grief, if not love persevering? <br><br>
  (I wrote the last scentence in Chinese and added some visual effects.)
