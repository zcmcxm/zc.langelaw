abstract: Nothing is more important than health and safeness

<p>Spring Festival is when chinese people reunite with families.
  But for me, I may not be able to spend this festival with my families
  after 2019.
</p>
<p>I won't say it's sad but a journey.</p>
<p>I wrote this in the Spring Festival of 2021. The symmetric rectangles look
 like two red pockets, which everyone likes to recieve not just because
it contains new year wishes but also becasue it has MONEY :)</p>
<p>Nothing is more important than health and safeness.</p>
<p>敬颂春祺<br>Wish everyone 长安常安</p>
