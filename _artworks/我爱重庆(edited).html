<p>Nostalgia seems to be something unavoidable.</p>
<p>I'm from Chongqing, a municipality located in southwestern part of China.
It's famous for being the origin of hotpot (火锅) and a "fog city", so I wrote
 勒是雾都, which means this is the fog city in Chongqing dialect.</p>
<p>I miss my hometown, my families and friends there.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for everything happened there in my first 16 years.</p>
<p>Beautiful days.</p>
